# Simple-Typing-Speed-Test
The Simple Typing Speed Test project is designed to help users measure their typing speed and accuracy  while practicing Java programming skills. The program will display random sentences for users to type,  calculate their typing speed in words per minute (WPM), and determine their typing accuracy based on  errors made.
